`background-size: cover;` ensures that the image always fill the entire container. It will zoom in if the image is smaller than the container. Good choice if you wanna make sure no white space anywhere in the container.

`background-position: 0% X%;` crops X% of the top.

`background-position: center;` is the same as `background-position: 50% 50%;`. The center of the image will be the center of the container.

`background-position: left top;` means that left and top will not be cropped. Same as `backgroun-position: 0% 0%;`
